# Notes

The Mega Deals script is designed to dynamically generate HTML content for displaying different deals based on their start and end dates. Each deal is categorized into three phases: Past Deals, Current Deals, and Upcoming Deals. Deals are represented as objects with the following key values: Pre-launch Image, Countdown Image, Launch Image, URL, Start Date, and End Date.
